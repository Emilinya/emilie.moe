                            Adachi and Shimamura, two young women who attend the same high school, are inseparable
                            friends. Whether playing table tennis, chatting about favorite TV shows, or just relaxing
                            together, they're happy to share their days. When Adachi's friendship turns into romantic
                            attraction, the relationship begins to change, one day at a time.

                            Very cute slow-burn slice of life, do not expect any rapid developments. This story is
                            adapted into an anime, but I recommend reading the original light novels. You can probably
                            find the light novels online for free somewhere, or you could buy them from <a

                            A funny love story. It start off very silly, but becomes more serious eventually. It also
                            features a trans princess as a side character.

                            This is an exceptionally slow-burn slice of life romance. The main pair does eventually
                            become a couple, but it takes several hundred chapters. The story is officially published by
                            <a target="_blank" class="listLink" href="https://www.bilibilicomics.com/detail/mc82">

                                class="listLink" href="https://www.bilibilicomics.com/detail/mc82">
                                MangaDex</a>. While I do recommend supporting the creator, the reading experience on
                            Bilibili Comics is worse than on MangaDex. There are also
                            a lot more translated chapters on MangaDex, so you do need to switch over eventually.
                            Unfortunately, the MangaDex version has not been updated
                            in over a year.

                            This is one of the most famous lesbian manga. It is adapted into an anime, which covers
                            about half of the story. The anime is very good, so I would recommend watching that
                            initially. I own this manga physically, as well as the spin-off novels written by the author
                            of Adachi and Shimamura, and the two anthology spin-off volumes.

                            This comic has a lot of explicit lesbian sex, so keep that in mind. It is very dramatic,
                            which I typically don't like, but the
                            main couple is very cute, and it does have a happy ending. You can buy it physically at <a

                            Ayaka Sakurai is an excellent student, but she gets nervous at exams, so she had to settle
                            for a lesser high school than she expected. However, her teacher offered Ayaka a
                            recommendation letter to the school of her choice if she could convince the delinquent girl
                            Sora Honda to come to school. When Ayaka visited Sora at her home, Sora was quite willing
                            to go back to school, if Ayaka would agree to do one thing...

                            gets resolved, and the relationship becomes reciprocal. This story is also not picked up by
                            any english publisher, so you have to read it on
