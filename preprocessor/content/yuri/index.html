                    This is a list of the subjectively best lesbian media. Note that i exclusively consume
                    anime-adjacent media, so don't expect to see anything else. The list is in order from best to worst,
                    but I recommend everything in this list.

                            good representation
                            of a GNC man (I think, can't speak for them). The translation is very bad though.</p>
