                            Adachi and Shimamura, two young women who attend the same high school, are inseparable friends. Whether playing table
                            tennis, chatting about favorite TV shows, or just relaxing together, they're happy to share their days. When Adachi's
                            friendship turns into romantic attraction, the relationship begins to change, one day at a time.

                            Very cute slow-burn slice of life, do not expect any rapid developments. This story is adapted into an anime, but I recommend
                            reading the original light novels. You can probably find the light novels online for free somewhere, or you could buy them from <a target="_blank" class="listLink" href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Adachi-Shimamura-Light-Novel-Vol-1-Hitoma-Iruma/9781645055358?ref=grid-view&qid=1676751759144&sr=1-9">
                            bookdepository.com</a>. I own all the published books physically, so if you know me in real life, I would be happy to let you borrow them.

                            This is an exceptionally slow-burn slice of life romance. The main pair does eventually become a couple, but it takes several
                            hundred chapters. The story is officially published by <a target="_blank" class="listLink" href="https://www.bilibilicomics.com/detail/mc82?utm_source=mgd">

                            MangaDex</a>. While I do recommend supporting the creator, the reading experience on Bilibili Comics is worse than on MangaDex. There are also
                            a lot more translated chapters on MangaDex, so you do need to switch over eventually.

                            This is one of the most famous lesbian manga. It is adapted into an anime, which covers about half of the story. The anime is very good,
                            so I would recommend watching that initially. I own this manga physically, but am missing volumes four, six and seven. There exists a series
                            of spin-off novels written by the author of Adachi and Shimamura, which I also own.

                            main couple is very cute, and it does have a happy ending. You can buy it physically at <a target="_blank" class="listLink"

                            The relationship between the main characters feels a bit coercive in the beginning, but that gets resolved, and the relationship
                            becomes reciprocal. This story is also not picked up by any english publisher, so you have to read it on

                    <li><p>A Joyful Life</p><p>A love story between two women with a traumatic past, contains references to sexual assault and familial abuse.
                        The translation is a bit bad, but that just adds to the somewhat disorientating atmosphere.</p></li>
                    <li><p>That Time I Was Blackmailed By the Class's Green Tea Bitch</p><p>Very fun, obviously written by a lesbian. Has a rushed ending though.</p></li>
                    <li><p>She Is Also Cute Today</p><p>Very slow, no relationship in season 1, but there will supposedly be a season 2. Surprisingly good representation
                        of a GNC man (I think, can't speak for them). The translation is very bad though.</p></li>
